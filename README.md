llgo is a compiler for [Go](http://golang.org), written in Go, and using the
[LLVM](http://llvm.org) compiler infrastructure.

llgo is a fledgling, and is being developed primarily as an educational
exercise. It is not presently useful for real work. Progress will be reported
at [http://blog.awilkins.id.au](http//blog.awilkins.id.au).
